# Technical Architecture

SmartyPants is designed with a modular, scalable architecture that enables flexibility and extensibility. Here's an overview of the key components and how they interact:

## 1. Core Components

### 1.1 Data Ingestion Layer
- **Connectors**: Modular adapters for various data sources (Slack, Google Drive, etc.)
- **Data Preprocessor**: Cleans and normalizes incoming data
- **Sync Manager**: Handles scheduling and execution of data synchronization

### 1.2 Storage Layer
- **Document Store**: Efficiently stores raw and processed documents
- **Vector Database**: Manages embeddings for semantic search
- **Metadata Store**: Keeps track of document metadata and relationships

### 1.3 Embedding Engine
- **Embedding Service**: Generates vector representations of text
- **Model Manager**: Handles multiple embedding models and providers
- **Batch Processor**: Optimizes embedding generation for large datasets

### 1.4 Search Engine
- **Query Processor**: Interprets and expands user queries
- **Vector Search**: Performs similarity searches in the vector space
- **Result Ranker**: Sorts and filters search results based on relevance

### 1.5 LLM Integration
- **Provider Abstraction**: Unified interface for multiple LLM providers
- **Prompt Manager**: Handles template management and dynamic prompt generation
- **Response Processor**: Post-processes LLM outputs for consistency and safety

### 1.6 API Layer
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Exposes core functionalities via HTTP APIs
- **WebSocket Server**: Enables real-time communication for chat interfaces
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Manages user access and permissions

## 2. Supporting Services

### 2.1 Task Queue
- Manages asynchronous jobs like data ingestion and embedding generation
- Ensures reliable execution of background tasks

### 2.2 Cache Layer
- Improves performance by caching frequent queries and embeddings
- Implements intelligent cache invalidation strategies

### 2.3 Observability Stack
- **Logging Service**: Centralized log collection and analysis
- **Metrics Collector**: Gathers performance and usage statistics
- **Distributed Tracing**: Tracks requests across different components

### 2.4 Configuration Management
- Manages application settings and feature flags
- Enables dynamic configuration updates without restarts

## 3. Frontend Applications

### 3.1 Web Dashboard
- React-based single-page application
- Provides interface for system management and analytics

### 3.2 Mobile Apps
- Native iOS and Android applications
- Optimized for mobile interactions with the AI system

## 4. Deployment and Scaling

### 4.1 Containerization
- Docker images for each component
- Docker Compose for development and small-scale deployments

### 4.2 Orchestration
- Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts for production deployments
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for automatic scaling

### 4.3 Serverless Options
- Adaptations for serverless platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions)
- Optimized for event-driven architectures

## 5. External Integrations

### 5.1 AI Service Providers
- Abstraction layers for OpenAI, Hugging Face, and other LLM/embedding providers
- Credential management and usage tracking

### 5.2 Storage Providers
- Support for various blob storage solutions (S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage)
- Pluggable interface for adding new storage backends

### 5.3 Authentication Providers
- Integration with OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Support for enterprise SSO solutions

## 6. Development and Extensibility

### 6.1 Plugin System
- Allows for custom extensions and integrations
- Standardized interfaces for data sources, embeddings, and LLMs

### 6.2 API Client Libraries
- Generated SDKs for popular programming languages
- Simplified integration for developers

This architecture is designed to be both robust for production use and flexible for customization and extension. It leverages modern software design principles to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance across a wide range of use cases.
