# Supported Data Sources

We are continuously adding support for more data sources. Currently, we support the following data sources:

## Slack

You can configure Slack data source to fetch documents from your Slack workspace. You need the following information to configure Slack data source:

- Slack Bot Token
- Channel Name

To get the Slack Bot Token, you need to create a Slack App and install it in your workspace. After installing the app, you can get the Bot Token from the app settings.
Follow the instructions in `http://your-frontend-app.dev/datasources/slack/add` page to configure Slack data source.
